Using this tool you can:

- You can apply the faults you choose in the configuration menu to the images in the image library you want, and save these wrong images to the folder you want.
- You can apply these faults to all images as well as to a random number of images, creating a mixed library of faulty images without touching the remaining images.
- You can save the configuration of the fault you have applied, and view the fault plans you have saved as you wish.
- You can specify the rate of fault to be applied.
- For now, three different fault types can be applied offline to images (with .bmp extension) obtained from TOF camera.
